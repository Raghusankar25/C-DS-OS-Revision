#include <stdio.h>

int main()

    char ch='A';
    char *p;
    p = &ch;
    //access value and address of ch using variable ch
    printf("Value of ch: %c\n",ch);
    printf("Address of ch: %p\n",&ch);

    //access value and address of ch using pointer variable pCh
    printf("Value of ch: %c\n",*p);
    printf("Address of ch: %p\n",p);
    printf("Address of ch: %p",&p);

Output:
Value of ch: A
Address of ch: 0x7ffe4a9f089f
Value of ch: A
Address of ch: 0x7ffe4a9f089f
Address of ch: 0x7ffe4a9f08a0
